## 🔮 Vision

The Gogs (`/gɑgz/`) project aims to build a simple, stable and extensible self-hosted Git service that can be set up in the most painless way. With Go, this can be done with an independent binary distribution across all platforms that Go supports, including Linux, macOS, Windows and ARM-based systems.

## 📡 Overview

- Please visit [our home page](https://gogs.io) for user documentation.
- Please refer to [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for list of changes in each releases.
- Want to try it before doing anything else? Do it [online](https://try.gogs.io/gogs/gogs)!
- Having trouble? Help yourself with [troubleshooting](https://gogs.io/docs/intro/troubleshooting.html) or ask questions in [Discussions](https://github.com/gogs/gogs/discussions).
- Want to help with localization? Check out the [localization documentation](https://gogs.io/docs/features/i18n.html).
- Ready to get hands dirty? Read our [contributing guide](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Hmm... What about APIs? We have experimental support with [documentation](https://github.com/gogs/docs-api).

## 💾 Hardware requirements

- A Raspberry Pi or $5 Digital Ocean Droplet is more than enough to get you started. Some even use 64MB RAM Docker [CaaS](https://www.docker.com/blog/containers-as-a-service-caas/).
- 2 CPU cores and 512MB RAM would be the baseline for teamwork.
- Increase CPU cores when your team size gets significantly larger, memory footprint remains low.

## 💻 Browser support

- Please see [Semantic UI](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI#browser-support) for specific versions of supported browsers.
- The smallest resolution officially supported is **1024*768**, however the UI may still look right in smaller resolutions, but no promises or fixes.
