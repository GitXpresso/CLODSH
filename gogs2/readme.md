## ðŸ”® Vision

The Gogs (`/gÉ‘gz/`) project aims to build a simple, stable and extensible self-hosted Git service that can be set up in the most painless way. With Go, this can be done with an independent binary distribution across all platforms that Go supports, including Linux, macOS, Windows and ARM-based systems.

## ðŸ“¡ Overview

- Please visit [our home page](https://gogs.io) for user documentation.
- Please refer to [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for list of changes in each releases.
- Want to try it before doing anything else? Do it [online](https://try.gogs.io/gogs/gogs)!
- Having trouble? Help yourself with [troubleshooting](https://gogs.io/docs/intro/troubleshooting.html) or ask questions in [Discussions](https://github.com/gogs/gogs/discussions).
- Want to help with localization? Check out the [localization documentation](https://gogs.io/docs/features/i18n.html).
- Ready to get hands dirty? Read our [contributing guide](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Hmm... What about APIs? We have experimental support with [documentation](https://github.com/gogs/docs-api).

## ðŸ’Œ Features

- User dashboard, user profile and activity timeline.
- Access repositories via SSH, HTTP and HTTPS protocols.
- User, organization and repository management.
- Repository and organization webhooks, including Slack, Discord and Dingtalk.
- Repository Git hooks, deploy keys and Git LFS.
- Repository issues, pull requests, wiki, protected branches and collaboration.
- Migrate and mirror repositories with wiki from other code hosts.
- Web editor for quick editing repository files and wiki.
- Jupyter Notebook and PDF rendering.
- Authentication via SMTP, LDAP, reverse proxy, GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise with 2FA.
- Customize HTML templates, static files and many others.
- Rich database backend, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite3 and [TiDB](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb).
- Have localization over [31 languages](https://crowdin.com/project/gogs).

## ðŸ’¾ Hardware requirements

- A Raspberry Pi or $5 Digital Ocean Droplet is more than enough to get you started. Some even use 64MB RAM Docker [CaaS](https://www.docker.com/blog/containers-as-a-service-caas/).
- 2 CPU cores and 512MB RAM would be the baseline for teamwork.
- Increase CPU cores when your team size gets significantly larger, memory footprint remains low.

## ðŸ’» Browser support

- Please see [Semantic UI](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI#browser-support) for specific versions of supported browsers.
- The smallest resolution officially supported is **1024*768**, however the UI may still look right in smaller resolutions, but no promises or fixes.

# Docker Installation
![Docker](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25181517/117207330-263ba280-adf4-11eb-9b97-0ac5b40bc3be.png
# Docker for Gogs

![Docker pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/gogs/gogs?logo=docker&style=for-the-badge)

Visit [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/gogs) or [GitHub Container registry](https://github.com/gogs/gogs/pkgs/container/gogs) to see all available images and tags.

## Usage

To keep your data out of Docker container, we do a volume (`/var/gogs` -> `/data`) here, and you can change it based on your situation.

```sh
# Pull image from Docker Hub.
docker pull gogs/gogs

# Create local directory for volume.
mkdir -p /var/gogs

# Use `docker run` for the first time.
docker run --name=gogs -p 10022:22 -p 10880:3000 -v /var/gogs:/data gogs/gogs

# Use `docker start` if you have stopped it.
docker start gogs
```

Note: It is important to map the SSH service from the container to the host and set the appropriate SSH Port and URI settings when setting up Gogs for the first time. To access and clone Git repositories with the above configuration you would use: `git clone ssh://git@hostname:10022/username/myrepo.git` for example.

Files will be store in local path `/var/gogs` in my case.

Directory `/var/gogs` keeps Git repositories and Gogs data:

    /var/gogs
    |-- git
    |   |-- gogs-repositories
    |-- ssh
    |   |-- # ssh public/private keys for Gogs
    |-- gogs
        |-- conf
        |-- data
        |-- log

#### Custom directory

The "custom" directory may not be obvious in Docker environment. The `/var/gogs/gogs` (in the host) and `/data/gogs` (in the container) is already the "custom" directory and you do not need to create another layer but directly edit corresponding files under this directory.

#### Using Docker volumes

```sh
# Create docker volume.
$ docker volume create --name gogs-data

# Use `docker run` for the first time.
$ docker run --name=gogs -p 10022:22 -p 10880:3000 -v gogs-data:/data gogs/gogs
```

## Settings

### Application

Most of the settings are obvious and easy to understand, but there are some settings can be confusing by running Gogs inside Docker:

- **Repository Root Path**: keep it as default value `/home/git/gogs-repositories` because `start.sh` already made a symbolic link for you.
- **Run User**: keep it as default value `git` because `build/finalize.sh` already setup a user with name `git`.
- **Domain**: fill in with Docker container IP (e.g. `192.168.99.100`). But if you want to access your Gogs instance from a different physical machine, please fill in with the hostname or IP address of the Docker host machine.
- **SSH Port**: Use the exposed port from Docker container. For example, your SSH server listens on `22` inside Docker, **but** you expose it by `10022:22`, then use `10022` for this value. **Builtin SSH server is not recommended inside Docker Container**
- **HTTP Port**: Use port you want Gogs to listen on inside Docker container. For example, your Gogs listens on `3000` inside Docker, **and** you expose it by `10880:3000`, but you still use `3000` for this value.
- **Application URL**: Use combination of **Domain** and **exposed HTTP Port** values (e.g. `http://192.168.99.100:10880/`).

Full documentation of application settings can be found [here](https://github.com/gogs/gogs/blob/main/conf/app.ini).

### Container options

This container has some options available via environment variables, these options are opt-in features that can help the administration of this container:

- **SOCAT_LINK**:
  - <u>Possible value:</u>
      `true`, `false`, `1`, `0`
  - <u>Default:</u>
      `true`
  - <u>Action:</u>
      Bind linked docker container to localhost socket using socat.
      Any exported port from a linked container will be binded to the matching port on localhost.
  - <u>Disclaimer:</u>
      As this option rely on the environment variable created by docker when a container is linked, this option should be deactivated in managed environment such as Rancher or Kubernetes (set to `0` or `false`)
- **RUN_CROND**:
  - <u>Possible value:</u>
      `true`, `false`, `1`, `0`
  - <u>Default:</u>
      `false`
  - <u>Action:</u>
      Request crond to be run inside the container. Its default configuration will periodically run all scripts from `/etc/periodic/${period}` but custom crontabs can be added to `/var/spool/cron/crontabs/`.
- **BACKUP_INTERVAL**:
  - <u>Possible value:</u>
      `3h`, `7d`, `3M`
  - <u>Default:</u>
      `null`
  - <u>Action:</u>
      In combination with `RUN_CROND` set to `true`, enables backup system.\
      See: [Backup System](#backup-system)
- **BACKUP_RETENTION**:
  - <u>Possible value:</u>
      `360m`, `7d`, `...m/d`
  - <u>Default:</u>
      `7d`
  - <u>Action:</u>
      Used by backup system. Backups older than specified in expression are deleted periodically.\
      See: [Backup System](#backup-system)
- **BACKUP_ARG_CONFIG**:
  - <u>Possible value:</u>
      `/app/gogs/example/custom/config`
  - <u>Default:</u>
      `null`
  - <u>Action:</u>
      Used by backup system. If defined, supplies `--config` argument to `gogs backup`.\
      See: [Backup System](#backup-system)
- **BACKUP_ARG_EXCLUDE_REPOS**:
  - <u>Possible value:</u>
      `test-repo1`, `test-repo2`
  - <u>Default:</u>
      `null`
  - <u>Action:</u>
      Used by backup system. If defined, supplies `--exclude-repos` argument to `gogs backup`.\
      See: [Backup System](#backup-system)
- **BACKUP_EXTRA_ARGS**:
  - <u>Possible value:</u>
      `--verbose --exclude-mirror-repos`
  - <u>Default:</u>
      `null`
  - <u>Action:</u>
      Used by backup system. If defined, append content to arguments to `gogs backup`.\
      See: [Backup System](#backup-system)

## Backup system

Automated backups with retention policy:

- `BACKUP_INTERVAL` controls how often the backup job runs and supports interval in hours (h), days (d), and months (M), eg. `3h`, `7d`, `3M`. The lowest possible value is one hour (`1h`).
- `BACKUP_RETENTION` supports expressions in minutes (m) and days (d), eg. `360m`, `2d`. The lowest possible value is 60 minutes (`60m`).

## Upgrade

:exclamation::exclamation::exclamation:<span style="color: red">**Make sure you have volumed data to somewhere outside Docker container**</span>:exclamation::exclamation::exclamation:

Steps to upgrade Gogs with Docker:

- `docker pull gogs/gogs`
- `docker stop gogs`
- `docker rm gogs`
- Finally, create a container for the first time and don't forget to do the same for the volume and port mapping.

## Known issues

- The docker container cannot currently be built on Raspberry 1 (armv6l) as our base image `alpine` does not have a `go` package available for this platform.
